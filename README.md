My first but still interesting game. The main point is to not look at its code. This is third person shooter with some mechanics.
__This intros, sprites and dialog system made mostly not by me but by Dmutre__

You can drink various (extually 3 variants) potions. Monsters can use them too. Also when you point at something you can see info about this thing.

All enemies have their own ai so they act differently.

Examples of my work

To run game just go _Builds_->___Name of the game___->Find exe file (Not unity crash handler) (or find apk file with this name)
