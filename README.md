My first but still interesting game. The main point is to not look at its code. This is third person shooter with some mechanics.
__This intros, sprites and dialog system made mostly not by me but by Dmutre__

All enemies have their own ai so they act differently.

Examples of my work

To run game just go _Builds_->___Name of the game___->Find exe file (Not unity crash handler) (or find apk file with this name)
