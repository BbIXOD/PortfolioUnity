### Alchemist (AKA Alch)

https://github.com/BbIXOD/Portfolio/assets/108470719/f11cef85-5f13-4fcf-bc42-b555fb812546

My first but still interesting game. The main point is to not look at its code. This is third person shooter with some mechanics.

__This intros, sprites and dialog system made mostly not by me but by Dmutre__

You can drink various (extually 3 variants) potions. Monsters can use them too. Also when you point at something you can see info about this thing.

All enemies have their own ai so they act differently.

### Tanks

What makes it different? This is armour system, where collision angle matters, this is destructable tank modules, this is ability to drive mulicannon and multiturrent monsters.

I used Photon to add room multiplayer system. You put same id and volia, you in same room!

Just a finished 2d car game. Actually infinite runner. Mainly designed for android. Thanks to Leadsdoit for sprites)

### Hill Climb Racing clone (AKA SimpleCarGame)


https://github.com/BbIXOD/Portfolio/assets/108470719/83f9adb9-24e1-4948-89cc-d7764a4b1d4c


This is small replica of hill climb racing. What makes it interesting is infinite chunk-based procedurally generated map and it cross-platform. In other is just a small pet-project. 

### Balls
